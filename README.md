[The Cancer Geonome Atlas](https://cancergenome.nih.gov) (TCGA) "a landmark cancer genomics program, molecularly characterized over 20,000 primary cancer and matched normal samples spanning 33 cancer types. This joint effort between the National Cancer Institute and the National Human Genome Research Institute began in 2006, bringing together researchers from diverse disciplines and multiple institutions.

Over the next dozen years, TCGA generated over 2.5 petabytes of genomic, epigenomic, transcriptomic, and proteomic data. The data, which has already lead to improvements in our ability to diagnose, treat, and prevent cancer, will remain publicly available for anyone in the research community to use."

This analysis, written in R, looks at microRNA (miRNA) sequences and clinical data for Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcoma (HNSC) from TCGA attempting to identify statistically significant biomarkers indicating lymphovascular invasion presence across clinical stages and predicting survival. With [A novel microRNA signature
predicts survival in liver hepatocellular carcinoma after hepatectomy](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-018-26374-9) as inspiration, this analysis was completed as a capstone project for STAT 685 under the supervision of [Dr. Moumita Karmakar](https://stat.tamu.edu/people/#all-k) for a MS in Applied Statistics at Texas A&M University in 2020.
